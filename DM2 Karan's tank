solution:
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    float r,h,o,t,v,n;
    cin>>r>>h>>o>>t;
    v=2*3.14*r*h;
    n=o*t;
    if(v<=n)
    {
        printf("The tank can be filled within"" " "%.1f"" " "hours",t);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("The tank cannot be filled within"" " "%.1f"" " "hours",t);
    }
    return 0;
}
