He was known for barreling into battle clutching two swords, with several knives and pistols at the ready. He captured over forty merchant ships in the Caribbean, and without flinching killed many prisoners. Stoneheart and his three pirates found a treasure of gold coins Short Fin too joined them. They decided to share the treasure. Stoneheart agreed to give x % share for Short Fin. He then decided to take y % share from the remaining treasure. His other pirates willl share equally the remaining gold coins. Write a program to compute their share's. 

INPUT FORMAT: 

Input consists of 3 integers. 

The first input corresponds to the number of gold coins in the treasure. 

The second input corresponds to Finn's share percentage 

The last input is Stoneheart's share percentage. 

OUTPUT FORMAT: 

The output consists of three integers. 

The first output integer corresponds to Short Fin's share. 

The second integer corresponds to Stoneheart's share. 

The last integer corresponds to other pirates share.
